# General Guidelines
- Code must be readable
- Use verbose variable names
- Add comments to explain complex part of code
- Add your name in README.md Authors section with github alias (without link)
- Use *asserts for tests*, so that it's easy for us to add tests in the future

## Adding/Modifying Code
- Please make sure code you're adding must be compatible with latest stable version of programming language
- Add test cases to confirm your code. Add both positive and negative cases
- Add tests in a separate function sot they can be imported in a single checker/tester script later. Call this test function in your program's main function
- Try to write code which is modular and importable

## Suggesting new programming language or algorithm
- To add new programming language create an issue and pull request with a directory language name and a '.gitkeep' file in that directory
- To add new algorithm, create an issue/pull request for same
